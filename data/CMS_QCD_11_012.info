Description: 
   A measurement of the underlying event activity using Drell-Yan events using muonic final state.
   The production of charged particles with pseudorapidity |eta| < 2 and
   transverse momentum pT > 0.5 GeV/c is studied in towards, transverse and away region w.r.t. to
   the direction of di-muon system. The UE activity is measured in terms of of a particle density 
   and an energy density. The particle density is computed as the average number of primary charged
   particles per unit pseudorapidity and per unit azimuth. The energy density is expressed in terms
   of the average of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of primary charged particles per unit
   pseudorapidity and azimuth.  The ratio of the energy and particle density is also reported in 3 regions. 
   UE activity  is studied as a function of invariant mass of muon pair (M_mumu)
   by limiting the ISR contribution by requiring transverse momentum of muon pair ( pT_mumu) < 5 GeV/c. The pT_mumu
   dependence is studied for the events having M_mumu in window of 81-101 GeV^{c}. The normalized charged particle 
   multiplicity and pT spectrum of the charged particles in three regions also been reported for events having M_mumu in window of 81-101 GeV^{c}.
   multiplicity and pT spectrum in the transverse also reported in for events having pT_mumu < 5 GeV/c.
