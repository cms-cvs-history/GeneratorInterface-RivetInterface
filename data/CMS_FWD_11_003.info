Description: Ratio of the energy deposited in the  pseudorapidity range -6.6 < eta < -5.2 for events with a charged particle jet with |eta| <2 with respect to the energy in  inlcusive events, as afunction of charged particle jet transverse momentum for sqrt(s)=0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV.
	     The histograms show dE/d \eta for inclusive events and events with a charged particel jet (pt_jet >10GeV) in the central region 		     range |eta| < 2.
	     The ratio histograms show the energy deposition as a function of the leading jet pT.
