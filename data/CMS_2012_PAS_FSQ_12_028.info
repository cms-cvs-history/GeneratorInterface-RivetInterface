Description: 
'Observables sensitive to the double parton scattering which can be used to discriminate against the single parton scattering process, are investigated.

Observables: azimuthal separations between two jets, relative pT balance of two jets, angle between W and dijet vector in azimuthal plane. 
Distributions are provided with absolute normalization as well as normalized to area. 
Measurement is performed in three event classes: 
   (1) exclusive two jet selection 
   (2) inclusive two jet selection:
      (2a) leading two jets are considered for defining observables
      (2b) best pT balanced pair of jet is considered for defining observables.'
