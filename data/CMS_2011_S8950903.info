Description:
  Measurements of dijet azimuthal decorrelations in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV using the CMS
  detector at the CERN LHC are presented. The analysis is based on an inclusive dijet event sample
  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9/pb. The results are compared to predictions from
  perturbative QCD calculations and various Monte Carlo event generators. The dijet azimuthal distributions
  are found to be sensitive to initial-state gluon radiation.
