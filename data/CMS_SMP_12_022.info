Description:
   'Hadronic EventShape Variables (Transverse Thrust, Thrust Minor, Total Jet Broadening) are studied in pp Collision at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV by CMS.The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns.Jet Clustering is performed using the AntiKt5-PFJet($R=0.5$) algorithm.Other jet algorithms (Kt4, AntiKt7) are also used to study the systematic effect due to the choice of jet algorithm.Events having jets with jet$p_\T>30$ GeV, and two leading jets within $|\eta|<1.3$ are only considered.Event shapes are calculated with all jets within $|\eta|<2.6$.The analysis is binned in leading jet $p_\T$ bins(in GeV).They are 110-170,170-250,250-320,320-390 and >390 respectively .All data is fully corrected.'
