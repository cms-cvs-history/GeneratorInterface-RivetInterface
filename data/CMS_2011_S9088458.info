Description:
  A measurement of the ratio of the inclusive 3-jet to 2-jet cross sections as a function of the total jet
  transverse momentum, HT, in the range 0.2 < HT < 2.5 TeV is presented. The data have been collected
  at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, and correspond
  to an integrated luminosity of 36/pb.
