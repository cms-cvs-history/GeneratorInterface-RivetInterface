RunInfo:
  Non-single-diffractive (NSD) events only.  Should include double-diffractive (DD) events
  and non-diffractive (ND) events but NOT single-diffractive (SD) events.  In Pythia6 the
  SD processes to be turned off are 92 and 93.  In Pythia8 the SD processes are 103 and
  104 (also called SoftQCD:singleDiffractive).

Description:
  'The spectra of Kshort, Lambda, and Cascade- particles were measured versus
  transverse-momentum (pT) and rapidity(y) in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass
  energies 900 and 7000 GeV.  The production is normalized to all non-single-diffractive
  (NSD) events using corrections for trigger and selection efficiency, acceptance, and
  branching ratios.  The results cover a rapidity range of |y|<2 and a pT range from 0 to
  10 GeV (Kshort and Lambda) and 0 to 6 GeV (Cascade-).  Antiparticles are included in all
  measurements so only the sum of Lambda and Lambdabar and Cascade- and anti-Cascade- are
  given.  The rapidity distributions are shown versus |y| but normalized to a unit of y.
  Ratios of Lambda/Kshort and Cascade-/Lambda production versus pT and |y| are also given,
  with somewhat smaller systematic uncertainties than obtained from taking the ratio of
  the individual distributions.'
